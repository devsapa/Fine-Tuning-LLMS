# Fine-Tuning-LLMS
Workshop - Fine-tuning LLMs
arge Language Models (LLMs) have opened up new possibilities of text generation and understanding over the past few years. These LLM serve as foundations for various NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis, sumamrization, machine translation, conversational chatbots, etc. The emergence of powerful generative LLMs such as CodeWhisperer and ChatGPT made a huge impact in the way content is developed and delivered.

In this  workshop, you will learn to build a foundational understanding of LLM and use a pre-trained LLM to generate responses. You can then fine-tune the pre-trained LLM for a given task and analyze the differences in generated responses. Additionally, you can explore different techniques to evaluate LLMs and analyze certain limitations such as bias and hallucination, commonly exhibited by LLMs. Finally, you can deploy the fine-tuned LLM to an endpoint using Sagemaker and use the endpoint for inference.
